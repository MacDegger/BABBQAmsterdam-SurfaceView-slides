# BABBQAmsterdam-SurfaceView-slides
The slides I used for the presentation I gave at the Big Android BBQ Amsterdam. All about getting your SurfaceView set up so it can render as fast as it can. The slides contain a lot of info, but  I guess the notes/what I said accompanying them was really where the meat and bones of the talk was. Nontheless, these do contain some good info.
